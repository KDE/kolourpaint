Ribbon branch
=============

![](https://invent.kde.org/-/project/2493/uploads/6f02a3879549cd0bf5bd109f1ed3e192/Screenshot_20250710_034048.png)

This branch requires [SARibbon](https://github.com/czyt1988/SARibbon) to be installed.

The old kp*ToolBar's are still created, they are just hidden. They couldn't be removed because their state (eg. of the colour widget) is used as the prime source of truth by the application and moving these into new variables inside the kpMainWindow class would take a larger re-write which is outside the scope of this branch. As such, the ribbon modifies the state of the widgets in the original, hidden, dialogs.

What is KolourPaint?
====================

KolourPaint is a free, easy-to-use paint program by KDE.

It aims to be conceptually simple to understand; providing a level of
functionality targeted towards the average user.  It's designed for daily
tasks like:

* Painting - drawing diagrams and "finger painting"
* Image Manipulation - editing screenshots and photos; applying effects
* Icon Editing - drawing clipart and logos with transparency

It's not an unusable and monolithic program where simple tasks like drawing
lines become near impossible.  Nor is it so simple that it lacks essential
features like Undo/Redo.

KolourPaint is opensource software written in C++ using the Qt and KDE
libraries.
