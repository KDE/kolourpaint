    //
    // This should be used in only 3 circumstances:
    //
    // 1. Tools not acting on the selection but using Color Similarity
    //    e.g. Color Eraser, Flood Fill, Auto Crop.  Note that Auto Crop
    //    becomes Remove Internal Border when a selection is active but
    //    the flashing still occurs because the extent of the effect is
    //    directly dependent on Color Similarity.
    //
    // 2. A change to selection transparency (background color, color similarity
    //    percentage, change from opaque to transparent).
    //
    //    It is not used when the transparency is opaque or when changing from
    //    transparent to opaque, as you're not using Color Similarity in these
    //    cases.
    //
    //    Similarly, it is not used when there is no image selection or the
    //    image selection is just a border, as changing the selection
    //    transparency also does nothing in these cases.
    //
    // 3. Pulling a selection from the document, when selection transparency
    //    is transparent.
    //
    //    Except for any pulling phase, it is not used for effects that use
    //    the "transparent image" of a selection (e.g. smearing a transparent
    //    selection).  This is to minimize distractions and because the flashing
    //    has already been done by pulling.
    //
    // This should always be called _before_ an operation related to Color
    // Similarity, to indicate that the Color Similarity was applied throughout
    // the operation -- not at the end.  This aspect is most noticeable for
    // the time-consuming Autocrop feature, which may fail with a dialog --
    // it would look wrong to only flash the Color Similarity Tool Bar Item when
    // the dialog comes up after the failed operation, as it implies that Color
    // Similarity was not used during the operation.  Having said all this,
    // currently the flashing still happens afterwards because the flashing is
    // not done in a separate thread.  However, assume that the implementation
    // will be fixed later.
    //
    // It is tempting to simply disable the Color Similarity Tool Bar Item
    // if the current tool does not use Color Similarity - this change in
    // enabled state would be enough to highlight the existence of Color
    // Similarity, without the need for this flashing.  However, Auto Crop
    // is always available - independent of the current tool - and it uses
    // Color Similarity, so we can never disable the Tool Bar Item.
    //
    // We flash in tools but not commands as else it would be very distracting
    // Undo/Redo - this flashing in the tools is distracting enough already :)
