// Histogram Equalizer effect.
//
// It just divides out the color histogram from the pixel values. (So if
// you plot the color histogram after equalizing, you should get a nearly
// flat/uniform distribution.)
//
// The two sliders adjust:
//
// 1. The extent to which it equalizes
// 2. The local-ness of the equalization. (In other words, it computes just
//    the histogram of the regions near the pixel it is adjusting.)
//
// ASSUMPTION: The given <image> is not paletted (currently, this is the
//             same as the screen mode not being paletted).
