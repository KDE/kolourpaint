//
// ASSUMPTION: There is a current selection.
//
//
// In all cases, the document is resized to be the same size as the bounding
// rectangle of the selection.  Additional behavior depends on the type of
// selection:
//
//
// If it's a text box:
//
// 1. It's moved to (0, 0) and kept editable.
//
// 2. The document background always becomes completely transparent.
//
//    Text boxes with transparent backgrounds, before calling this method,
//    antialias their text with the pixels of the document below.  Such
//    pixels are unlikely to be all of the same color, so there is no single
//    "correct" color for the new document background.  We choose transparent
//    because it's the most neutral and forces the text to not antialias.
//    TODO: Perhaps a better approach would have been to simply copy the
//          pixels of the document below the text box to (0, 0)?
//
//    For text boxes with opaque backgrounds, the new transparent document
//    background means that the extents of text boxes are clear, when the
//    boxes are moved around -- this is handy.
//
//
// If it's an image selection:
//
// 1. The pixels of the document starting from position (0, 0) are set the
//    same as those inside the selection region.  Unlike other image selection
//    commands, if the selection is not floating, there is still no pulling
//    of the selection from the document.
//
//    The pixels outside the selection region are set to the background color.
//
// 2. The selection border is discarded -- even if the selection was floating
//    before -- and replaced by a new one, of the same shape, but located at (0, 0).
//    This allows the user to pull off a selection, if they would like.
//
//    For user convenience, this border is created by a undoable
//    create-selection-border command added to the undo history.
