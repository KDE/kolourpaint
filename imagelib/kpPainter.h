// Stateless painter with sane semantics that works on kpImage's i.e. it
// works on document - not view - data.  If you find that you need state,
// you should probably move it into kpPainter to avoid the overhead of
// passing around this state (e.g. color, line width) and for reuse.
//
// kpPainter is to kpImage as QPainter is to QPixmap.
//
// This encapsulates the set of functionality used by all of KolourPaint's
// document drawing functions and nothing more, permitting rewriting of
// the image library.  Currently uses QPainter/kpPixmapFX as the image library.
