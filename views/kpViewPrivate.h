    // Normally, these pointers must be valid while the kpView is alive.
    // Generally, the objects they point to are deleted only after kpView
    // is deleted.
    //
    // However, sometimes we use deleteLater() for the kpView.
    // Before the delayed deletion is executed, those objects are deleted
    // and then our paintEvent() is called.  paintEvent() must therefore
    // have some way of realising that those objects have been deleted so
    // we use guarded pointers.
