// A tool window with the following properties, in order of importance:
//
// 1. Stays on top of its parent window, but not on top of any other
//    window (this rules out Qt::WindowStaysOnTop)
// 2. Does not auto-hide when its parent window loses focus
//    (this rules out Qt::Tool).
// 3. Does not have a taskbar entry.
// 4. TODO: Does not take keyboard focus away from the parent window,
//          when it is shown.
// 5. TODO: Is not in the Alt+Tab list
//
// We mean "tool window" in the window system sense.  It has nothing to do
// with kpTool so to avoid confusion, we do not name it "kpToolWindow".
