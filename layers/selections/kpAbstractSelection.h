// Abstract base class for selections.
//
// Selections consist of:
//
// 1. Bounding rectangle (provided by this base class) relative to the
//    source document
// 2. Border (must be on, or inside, the bounding rectangle and does not
//    have to be rectangular)
// 3. Optional content (e.g. image or text).
//
// A selection without content is a selection border.
//
// Any content outside the border should not be rendered i.e. the selection
// is transparent in all areas outside of the border.  Pixels on, or inside,
// the border are considered to be renderable content.  Parts, or all, of
// this content can be transparent.
