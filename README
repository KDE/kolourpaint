1. What is KolourPaint?
=======================

KolourPaint is a free, easy-to-use paint program for KDE.

It aims to be conceptually simple to understand; providing a level of
functionality targeted towards the average user.  It's designed for daily
tasks like:

* Painting - drawing diagrams and "finger painting"
* Image Manipulation - editing screenshots and photos; applying effects
* Icon Editing - drawing clipart and logos with transparency

It's not an unusable and monolithic program where simple tasks like drawing
lines become near impossible.  Nor is it so simple that it lacks essential
features like Undo/Redo.

KolourPaint is opensource software written in C++ using the Qt and KDE
libraries.
